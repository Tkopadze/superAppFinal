          “Nothing good is going on in my life” <br />A daily thought I used to
          wake up and sleep to. The days felt all the same and the food started
          to taste pale. I’ve done everything that I was asked to do. <br />
          Got good grades, was admitted into a good university, and landed the
          perfect job. <br />“Is this everything that life has to offer” <br />
          When I was younger, I felt full of life. Who cares if I scored 60% on
          my physics exam, I’ll just perform better in the next one. Who cares
          if a couple of people stopped talking to me, I’ll just make more
          friends. I studied, played and took time to read books. <br />
          As I reach my 20’s, all those things that once did not move a needle,
          were a lasting cyclone in my mind. The cycle of life started to turn
          into a mouse’s maze where no matter how much you tried, you could not
          escape. <br />
          Wake up, go to work, come back, sleep. <br />
          You repeat the cycle and think to yourself — “Is this it?” <br />
          You’ve reached an emotional state where nothing matters but here is
          what I read that might just help you get a different outlook on life
          <br />
          “The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely
          free that your very existence is an act of rebellion”. — Albert Camus
          <br />
          Absurdism <br />This philosophy is as simple as it sounds. <br />
          Life is absurd. <br />
          You are born in a world where the rules have already been laid down.
          If you try to spread your wings there are people beside you who will
          cut them even before you learn how to fly. You work, you eat, you do
          everything but forget to answer that one important question — are you
          happy? <br />Absurdism is a philosophical outlook that explores the
          contradiction between the human desire for meaning and the
          indifferent, chaotic nature of the universe. <br />The life you live
          is irrational and sometimes devoid of true meaning/purpose. We think
          that life is tragic because it is wretched and constantly find ways to
          blame others, making us bitter. <br />
          Absurdism does not fight to tell you the meaning of life, on the
          contrary, it just states that there is no meaning in life. Wait, So
          How is This a Philosophy? <br />
          When you’ve been forced to find meaning in life, you pull your hair
          out to search for it. You try to find it in hobbies, in your
          monochrome jobs and sometimes in other people too. When you’re unable
          to find it, you tend to experience all those negative emotions of
          nothingness. <br />
          So what if I tell you that you don’t ‘need’ to find a meaning? What if
          there is no meaning and the journey is more important than the lesson
          it teaches? <br />
          I looked up at the mass of signs and stars in the night sky and laid
          myself open for the first time to the benign indifference of the
          world. <br />
          — Albert Camus, “The Stranger” <br />At its core, absurdism
          acknowledges the contradictions and irrationalities of the human
          condition. It recognizes that life is inherently meaningless and
          devoid of inherent value. You don’t come into this life with a purpose
          defined — the journey becomes fun when you try to give it meaning
          itself. <br />
          Instead of succumbing to nihilism or despair, absurdism invites us to
          confront the absurdity of existence head-on and find meaning in the
          face of chaos. <br />
          Too Technical? <br />
          Here’s how it helped me. Last year the place I was working at lost
          their investments and the entire business was shut down. It was my
          first job and while most of my friends were building their banks, I
          was fighting to keep myself employed. <br />
          “Why me?” was a question that I could not stop asking myself. As a
          person in despair, I had started spending time sitting on my bed and
          binging shows to detach myself from reality. <br />
          As a person who started embracing the absurd, I thought
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is not my fault the company lost business. These things happen
            more usually than I know, I just happened to experience it early in
            my career.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is not the last job in the world, a month or even two — I’ll land
            an even better one.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The moment I started adding “so what” to these terrible feelings, life
          started to make sense again <br />
          So what I’m earning less right now <br />So what if I don’t have my
          own business yet <br />
          If not now, then later. If the purpose of life is to create a purpose,
          I will build mine soon. <br />
          This absurdism helped me to start my blog. <br />
          “What the worst that could happen, no one would read it?” <br />Well,
          yes, when I took that “so what” and started doing the things that
          scared me the most — I was building a life where I am not afraid to
          chase after my dreams.
